**Assignment: Header Comments**

**CIS 282**

**To turn in:**

- Attach one file: **header\_comments\_lastname.rb** as an attachment to the assignment in Canvas.

**Coding Conventions** :

- file names
  - all lower case
  - use underline to separate words in your variables and filenames
  - examples: my\_homework.rb, homework.rb
- variables
  - all lower case
  - use underline to separate words
  - no acronyms
  - no shortened words
  - descriptive, not generic
  - examples: age, first\_name, address, home\_address
- conditional expressions
  - align and indent

**To do:**

- Write a Ruby program which will prompt the user for 5 different items:
  - Name
  - Date
  - Assignment
  - Class Number
  - Description

Store each of the above values into an appropriate variable name.

Use these variables to print out a formatted Header Comment using the information from the user. The header comment should look EXACTLY like the following, down to spacing, alignment, and number of #&#39;s

This header output MUST then be copied and inserted into the top of your program for this and all future assignments.

NOTE: Beware of using a variable named &quot;class&quot;.

HINT: There are 60 # symbols on the top and bottom lines

Program Output should look like this â€“ EXACTLY, with the user&#39;s input replacing the fields appropriately.
